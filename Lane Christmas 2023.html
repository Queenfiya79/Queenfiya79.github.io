        <H2>FAQ about the website:</H2>

        <body>
            <p>
                <li>Can I add a child/spouse/parent to my group if they don't have an email address?
                Yes! On the page where you add items to your wishlist, we have an "Add Another Person's Wishlist"
                    button in the "Wishlist Settings" box which allows you to add as many people as you want with a
                    single login.
                    We have people who use this when they want to share the kids’ wishlists with the family or they have
                    couples who
                    share the same email address.</li>


                <li>Can I set up rules to prevent certain people from picking each other?

                    Absolutely. Once you have everyone listed on the group page that you want to have in the drawing,
                    click the “Draw Names” button. It will take you through two steps. The first step allows you to
                    leave someone out of the drawing (like kids if you are sharing their wishlists with the group).
                    The second step lets you select each person in your group and then uncheck any names you don’t want
                    them to pick.
                    Sometimes people use that to make sure spouses don’t pick each other for example. Once you finish
                    the “Draw Names”
                    steps, an email will go out letting everyone know that they need to sign in and see the name they
                    picked!</li>


                <li>I have a large group and I don't have all of their email addresses. How can I invite everyone?

                    The easiest way to invite everyone is to send a single invite to your own email address, and then
                    you
                    can share that link/invite code with everyone. You might do that using a Facebook post, common
                    message board,
                    or other method that you use to communicate with the group. Multiple people can use the same invite
                    link/code to join
                    your group.</li>
